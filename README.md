# Customer Ad Segmentation
----
## Project Description
A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.

I am tasked to do univariate and bivariate analysis using the R language to best advise her marketing strategy.
